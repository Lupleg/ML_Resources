### Using useState to Toggle a Button

Question: Write a simple React component that toggles a button's text between "ON" and "OFF" each time it's clicked using the useState hook.
Hint: You'll need to maintain a state variable that tracks whether the button is on or off.

### Using useEffect to Fetch Data

Question: Create a React component that fetches data from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and displays the first post's title. Use the useEffect hook to fetch the data when the component mounts.
Hint: You may use fetch() to get the data, and store it in state.

### Using useRef to Track Previous State

Question: Use the useRef hook to track the previous value of a counter (e.g., if the counter goes from 2 to 3, you should be able to display "Previous: 2" and "Current: 3").
Hint: useRef doesn't cause re-renders, so it's perfect for storing the previous value.
